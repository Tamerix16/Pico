# A very basic HID Keyboard example for Keybow 2040
# Inspired by: https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/usb/examples/device/keyboard_example.py

# This example requires a Pico USB compatible firmware, eg: pico_usb-1.23.0-pimoroni-micropython.uf2

# The pin order for Keybow 2040 is weird,
# But the below is laid out to match the pad with USB up
# from top left to bottom right.

    20: KeyCode.I, 16: KeyCode.J, 12: KeyCode.K, 8: KeyCode.L,
    21: KeyCode.M, 17: KeyCode.N, 13: KeyCode.O, 9: KeyCode.P,
